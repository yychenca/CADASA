                <p>"When we talk about AI, we're actually talking about three distinct levels of intelligence.</p>
                
                <p><span class="emphasis">Narrow AI</span> is what we have today ‚Äì systems that excel at specific tasks. Your chess engine that can beat grandmasters? That's narrow AI. The face recognition unlocking your phone? Also narrow AI. They're brilliant at one thing, but ask them to do anything else, and they're useless.</p>
                
                <p><span class="emphasis">General AI or AGI</span> <span class="gesture">[point to middle box]</span> ‚Äì this is the holy grail. An AI with human-like versatility that can learn any task, reason across domains, and adapt to new situations. We're not there yet, but we're getting closer.</p>
                
                <p>And then there's <span class="emphasis">Super AI</span> ‚Äì intelligence that surpasses human capabilities in every domain. This is still science fiction, but many researchers believe it's not a matter of if, but when.</p>

                <p>‚Ä¢ <span class="emphasis">Knowledge</span>: Every piece of human knowledge is encoded in language ‚Äì from scientific papers to Wikipedia.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <span class="emphasis">Reasoning</span>: We think in language. Our internal monologue, our problem-solving ‚Äì it's all linguistic.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <span class="emphasis">Culture</span>: Stories, values, beliefs ‚Äì transmitted through language across generations.<br>
                ‚Ä¢ <span class="emphasis">Logic</span>: Mathematical proofs, programming, formal reasoning ‚Äì all expressed through language.</p>
                
                <p>But here's what makes language truly special: it's <span class="emphasis">compositional</span>. With just 26 letters, we can express infinite ideas. We can describe things that don't exist, reason about the future, and even talk about language itself!</p>

                <p>"Let me show you something fascinating. Look at this sentence: <span class="emphasis">'A girl saw a boy with a telescope.'</span></p>

                <p>But here's the thing ‚Äì <span class="emphasis">you instantly knew which one was more likely</span>, didn't you? You didn't consciously calculate probabilities, but your brain did it automatically.</p>
                
                <p>This is Bayesian inference in action! <span class="gesture">[Point to formula]</span> Your brain computed: What's the probability of this interpretation given the context? What's more common in my experience?</p>
                
                <p>Language models do exactly the same thing. They've seen billions of sentences and learned these probability distributions. When they see 'A girl saw a boy with a...', they're calculating: what's most likely to come next? What interpretation makes the most sense given everything I've learned?</p>

                <p>The problem? They have terrible memory! By the time they get to the end of a long sentence, they've forgotten the beginning. It's like trying to understand a book but forgetting each page as you turn it.</p>
                
                <p>Then in 2017, everything changed with a paper called <span class="emphasis">'Attention is All You Need.'</span> <span class="gesture">[Point to right diagram]</span></p>
                
                <p>Transformers don't read sequentially ‚Äì they see everything at once. Every word can directly attend to every other word. It's like having perfect photographic memory of the entire context.</p>
